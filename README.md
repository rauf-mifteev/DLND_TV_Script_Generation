# TV Script Generation Project for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

## Project overview
In this project, I work on code in **Jupiter Notebook** that generates fake Simpsons TV scripts. I use **Tensorflow** to build a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** and train it on scripts of 27 seasons of Simpsons. 

## Prerequisites
The code is **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook** and it uses:

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

You can install everything you need to run this project with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

## Installing
Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/rauf-mifteev/DLND_TV_Script_Generation.git`

## Run the Code
Navigate to the cloned directories location and start jupyter notebook with dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb

`jupyter notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb`
