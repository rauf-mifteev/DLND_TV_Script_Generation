# TV Script Generation Project for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

In this project, I work on code in **Jupiter Notebook** that generates fake Simpsons TV scripts. I use **Tensorflow** to build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and train it on scripts of 27 seasons of Simpsons. 

## Prerequisites
The code is in a Jupyter Notebook. You can install Jupyter Notebook by installing [Anaconda](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-jupyter-using-anaconda-and-conda) or with pip

`pip3 install jupyter`

## Installing
Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/rauf-mifteev/DLND_TV_Script_Generation.git`

## Run the Code
Navigate to the cloned directories location and start jupyter notebook with dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb

`jupyter notebook dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb`
